Mentioned in ##windows by TheBard: onodera, are you perchance trying to dual boot?

Mentioned in ##windows by TheBard: onodera, there is an option in the installer for it to format your drive. Do so.
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, you doing raid ? bios set to ahci ?
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, no win installer does se linux partitons ext, resierfs atleast for others i have not tried
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, so it should see your drive there
Mentioned in ##windows by Ussat: <onodera> so in short: no, not yet
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, okej cant say if that works or not.. maybe best then to boot live and make it RAW
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, i agree on that
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, double check bios atleast first that it is set to AHCI
Mentioned in ##windows by Ussat: onodera, just drop to a term and use diskpart
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, diskpart
Mentioned in ##windows by merced: onodera: what v windows
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, did you check bios settings ?
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, it should be on the SATA settings
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, if you using IDE/RAID change to AHCI
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, okej just try to set default settings then... anyway that is a normal issue for win7 that it dont find device drivers when it is not set to ahci
Mentioned in ##windows by Mathisen: onodera, only thing i can think off that should mather.. like if it where xp you where trying to install it could have been just sata drivers but for win7 everything is there
